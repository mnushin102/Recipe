       <ol>
            <li>
                Soak dried shiitake mushrooms in hot water, stirring occasionally, until soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain well and slice into thin strips.
            </li>

            <li>
                Whisk soy sauce, vinegar, ground white pepper, and sesame oil together in a small bowl for hot and sour mixture; set aside until needed.
            </li>

            <li>
                Whisk cornstarch and water together in another small bowl for slurry; set aside until needed.
            </li>

            <li> 
                Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. 
                Add ginger, sliced green onions, and shiitake mushrooms. 
                Cook, stirring, for about 2 minutes. Pour in chicken broth and bring up to a simmer. 
                Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 5 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in carrot, red pepper, bamboo shoots, tofu, and the hot and sour mixture. Let simmer for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Raise heat to medium-high and bring to a boil. 
                Stir the soup slowly with a spoon while transferring in the beaten eggs in a steady stream to create thin ribbons. 
                Keep stirring until the soup comes back to a boil. Reduce heat to medium.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir the cornstarch slurry to make sure it's well blended, then slowly drizzle it into the soup while stirring constantly. 
                Soup should thicken up within 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Turn off heat, taste for seasoning, and serve.
